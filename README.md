# Matrices

This repository is about a very basic lib for matrix operations. 
It implements some matrix and linear algebra algorithms such as matrix sum/subtraction/multiplication, matrix distance, LU decomposition, determinant and back/forward substitution for solving linear systems.

This project was inspired by GNU GSL.

# Hardware Acceleration

Currently, this lib doesn't implement any hardware acceleration techniques for faster calculations, but it will be implemented soon. Support for BLAS will be added but it's not in my plans code a full CBLAS lib like gslcblas but rather a minimal one for only double real.
